/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////CHOMPEDIT Custom shadekin mini tutorial
//Proto shadekin; AKA; Basic how to make your own shadekin; -Shark

//Step 1; sprites;
//File for body = icons/mob/vore_shadekin.dmi
//File for tail = icons/mob/vore_shadekin64.dmi
//Sprites can be either made inside of DM or you can use a Program of your choice and save the files as PNG and then import them
//If you need help learning how to use DMs interface to import/export sprites and make states you can always ask in the discord.

//Step 2; Code
//Now this depends on what type of eye colour you want
//For a red we use
///mob/living/simple_animal/shadekin/red
//then we simply add our shadekins name at the end (unless its used already)
/mob/living/simple_animal/shadekin/red/proto
	name ="Proto"
	//This here will be our shadekins name

	desc = "An invisible entity not meant for use."
	//here goes a lil tidbit people can see when examining the shadekin. Multiple lines works just as on the vore part

	icon_state = "proto"
	//this will most likely also be your shadekins name, it corresponds to the name you gave the tail and body state in the DMIs
	//so if you named the body state "proto" and "proto-1" then icon_state should be called "proto"

	vore_stomach_flavor = "You stared into the void,\
	the void decided you look tasty,\
	now you are in the void, pretty wet"
	//This is what people see when they drop into your gut! the backslashes at the end of the sentence indicate the next text will be on its own line!


	player_msg = "Proto is you, Proto shouldn't exist"
	//This message pops up when you are put into your shadekin
	//I recommend you use it as a way to remind yourself of how you want to act generally as your shadekin.

//Step 3; PR
// Assuming you already have a Fork of chompstation, make sure you got your files in order
// and then simply make a new pull request to our github.

//Now once you pushed the new DMIs with your added sprites to our github.
//And you finished writing this code section for your shadekin and pushed that too. You are done.
//If this is your first time I recommend getting someone to look over your work.
